# Coursera-UCSDUnfoldingMaps
Coursework from the Object Oriented Java Specialization.
The program reads from an RSS feed and displays earthquake markers on a map and a key was created to segregate the different types of data. 
When the user hovers over a marker, the application displays features such as location, city, country and population. When a marker is clicked, cities within the threat circle of a surrounding earthquake are isolated.
